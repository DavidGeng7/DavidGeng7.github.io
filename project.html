            <h2>Competitve Programming</h2>
            <p>I have been doing competitive programming for a year now. I have participated in CCC and USACO. You can find my DMOJ profile in the footer.</p>
            <br><hr>
            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <p>The website you are on right now! Made for ICS4U and hosted using Github pages. It is made with HTML, CSS, and some Javascript.</p>
            <img src = "portfolio.png" alt = "portfolio" style = "width: 100%">
            <button onclick = "window.location.href = 'https://github.com/DavidGeng7/DavidGeng7.github.io';">View on Github</button>
            <br><br><br><hr>
            <h2>ScreenSaver - ISP - ICS3U</h2>
            <p>A screen saver program crated for the final project of ICS3U course. It featured 5 different screensaver with different animations. It is worked on by me and Leyang Zou. Unfortunatly it is marked as private on github so a couple of pictures will do for now.</p>
            <img src = "ics3u.png" alt = "ISP for ICS3U" style = "width: 250px; height: 200px;">

            <h2>StalinBot</h2>
            <p>A general purpose discord bot made using Discord.js by me on my free time. It is just something silly but it works. Here is a list of functions the bot can do. It has not been updated in a while, so I might revive the project when I have time.
                It is also private on github for security reasons.

            <h2>PnW Stalin Bot</h2>
            <p>Don't ask me why they are all called stalin bot. PnW Stalin Bot is a discord bot made using Discord.js during summer of 2020. It utilizes the Politics and War API (Politics and War is a browser game) to get information of nations in the game. It has also not been updated in a while, so I might revive the project when I have time.
                Here is a snip of what it can do. It is also private on github for security reasons.
